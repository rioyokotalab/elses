Release Notes for Version 1.1
30 January 2004

1. Added support for character references of the form &#dd; and &#xhh;
where dd is a decimal number and hh a hexadecimal number.

2. Revamped the reader module to perform a cleaner processing of
characters and line/column accounting, even with non-Unix end of
lines.

3. Added routine xml_char_count to request the value of the character
counter.

4. Initialize explicitly all components of derived-type variables at
run time (Fortran90 does not allow to do this at compile time).

5. Proper echo of the XML declarations when they
contain [, ], <, and > characters.
