GETTING STARTED QUICKLY

You should really read the User Guide, but if you insist, here is the
*minimum* you can do to get the parser working:

 * Define the environment variable FLIB_ROOT to point to the macros
   directory in the xmlf90 distribution
   (You could make it point anywhere, but this is the simplest setup,
    as you have everything under the same tree)

      FLIB_ROOT=/somewhere/xmlf90/macros ; export FLIB_ROOT (sh-like shells)
      setenv FLIB_ROOT /somewhere/xmlf90/macros           (csh-like shells)

 * Go into macros, look through the fortran-XXXX.mk files,
   and see if one of them applies to your computer/compiler combination. 
   If so, copy it or make a (symbolic) link to 'fortran.mk':

	ln -sf fortran-lf95.mk fortran.mk

   If none of the .mk files look useful, write your own, using the
   files provided as a guide. Basically you need to figure out the
   name and options for the compiler,  the extension assigned to
   module files, and the flag used to identify the module search path.

 The above steps need only be done once.

  Go back to the top directory.

  If you have a Fortran95 compiler, simply type "sh build.sh"
  If not, edit build.sh and comment out the DOM sections as directed.

 * Go into subdirectory 'Examples' and explore.

 * Go into subdirectory 'Tutorial' and try the exercises in the User Guide
  (see the next section for compilation details).

** Compiling user programs

After installation, the appropriate modules and library files should
already be in $FLIB_ROOT/modules and
$FLIB_ROOT/lib, respectively. To compile user programs, it
is suggested that the user create a separate directory to hold the
program files and prepare a Makefile following the templates in the
Examples/ directory.
