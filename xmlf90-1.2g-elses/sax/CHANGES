* New optional argument "record_size" in open_xmlfile. The default record 
length is 65536, but for overly long lines it might be necessary to specify
a larger size.

* Wrote "init_" routines to avoid undefined status for the components
of the buffer, dictionary, and elstack derived types (Fortran90 restriction). 
They are called just once at the beginning of execution.

The "reset_" routines just zero out the counters in the derived
types. This leads to substantial savings in overhead.

* Avoided when possible the allocation of temporaries (mostly strings) by
the compilers. This was particularly acute in the "action" records. The
typical idiom:

	action =trim("Reading character in name: " // c)

forced the allocation of a temporary.  The number of compiler allocations
(at least with NAG) has dropped down to just those needed in the processing
of entities.

* Put the explicit module dependencies in the makefile.

* Increased the standard size of the buffers and dictionaries.
***** The program now stops when those sizes are not enough.
