KNOWN ISSUES as of version 1.1.

** CHARACTER ENCODINGS

Only single-byte encodings are supported at this time.

** XPATH API.

This API is not solid yet, particularly in the area of contexts handling.
A new one is coming based on the DOM, but, not being stream-oriented, it
will loose its small memory footprint and speed.

** COMPILER SUPPORT.

The parser will not work with the (very old) PGI compiler pgf90 Version 3.2
due to a bug in their I/O. It runs well with Version 5.0.

You need a F95 compiler to process the DOM subsystem.
