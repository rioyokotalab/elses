This directory contains a very simple example of the use
of the XML parser.

The program, in file "example.f90", uses the module "m_handlers", which
contains the handlers for the basic events:  begin_element, end_element, and 
pcdata_chunk.

The program opens the XML file, obtaining a file object, and calls
xml_parse with the above handlers.

In this particular case, the handlers' action is just to print out 
element/attribute information, and to dump any PCDATA sections.

Turning on the 'verbose' flag in the call to xml_parse will result in a
more detailed look at the workings of the parser.

Type 'make' to compile, and 'example' to execute.
