Some examples of the use of the SAX API in Fortran.

Start by looking at the "simple" directory. That will give you a
feeling for the workings of the parser. Feel free to experiment
with "malforming" the "test.xml", and to turn on the "verbose"
flag in the call to "xml_parse" in example.f90.

"Count" contains a simple yet meaningful application of the parser: counting
the number of elements of different types in an XML file.

"Pseudo" is a scaled-down real-world physics application: reading a
data file and populating internal structures. It showcases the use of
"build_data_array" to turn homogeneous PCDATA sections into numerical arrays.

"Features" shows small snippets of all the constructs recognized by the
parser: treatment of quotes in attributes, standard entities, CDATA sections,
declarations, comments, etc.
