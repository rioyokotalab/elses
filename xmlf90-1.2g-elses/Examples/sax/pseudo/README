This directory contains a real-world example of processing an XML file.

Pseudo.xml is a prototype XML pseudopotential file, containing, apart
from identification information, several datasets representing functions
of a radial coordinate. These functions are given as tables with an underlying 
grid. The grid can be common to all, or each radial function ("radfunc") can
have its own.

The program reads the XML file and then constructs a data structure
with all the information in the file, ready to be processed by other
utilities, such as an electronic-structure program.

Pseudo.xml is just a prototype, and this program is just an illustration
of the kinds of idioms one can use to process a non-trivial XML file
using a SAX-like parser.

The basic data structures are defined in module m_pseudo_types, and the 
handlers are in m_pseudo.f90.

Type 'make' to compile, and 'pseudo' to execute.
(In the interest of simplicity, this program is hardwired to process
the 'pseudo.xml' file. For command-line control, one could use the
routines in the f2kcli module.)
